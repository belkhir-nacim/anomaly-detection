# Learning Geometric Transformations for Anomaly Detection
We extend the work by Golan _et al._ [1] by implementing the geometric transformations as spatial transformer modules [2].
This code was written during a "Project in Machine Learning" (236757) course at the Technion, Israel Institute of Technology.
